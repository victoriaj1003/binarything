1.  must iterate through array of exponents
	how?

2.  must iterate through the entire function until the user's input number = 0


non-hard-coded array...

3.  if input number is bigger than the power of 	2, must test next higher power of 2 so...
	Math.pow(2, i+1)

use algorithm to use more exponents of 2


750

input >= pow(2, x)

git bisect...  divide problem in half until you get to the answer
