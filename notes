1.  must iterate through array of exponents
	how?

2.  must iterate through the entire function until the user's input number = 0


non-hard-coded array...

3.  if input number is bigger than the power of 	2, must test next higher power of 2 so...
	Math.pow(2, i+1)

use algorithm to use more exponents of 2


750

input >= pow(2, x)

git bisect...  divide problem in half until you get to the answer


other stuff..
unit tests
fixtures in js testing
mocking libraries


// ******* document.getElementById("fred").reset(); doesn't work.  form reloads page, div it's not a method
// ******* if number is between 0 - 500, it runs, but you can't run it again by typing over input. if number is above or below the range, you can enter a new number and it runs, but if that number is inside range, you can't run again without reloading page....so clear form must reload page, but only if the number is inside the range?
